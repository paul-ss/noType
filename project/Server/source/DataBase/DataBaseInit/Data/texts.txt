I've seen places, faces and smiled for a moment. But oh, you haunted me so. Still my tongue tied, young pride would not let my love for you show in case you say no.
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was just about to come up and wake you so that I could tell you.
The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
I remember the night you were charged with practicing iambic pentameter without a license.
But the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason, because it is unreasonable.
We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand. Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you.
